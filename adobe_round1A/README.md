# Adobe PDF Outline Extractor – Hackathon Submission (Round 1A)

## 🚀 Overview

- This project extracts structured outlines (headings/sections) from PDFs in multiple languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.), including support for internal bookmarks, and outputs results as clean JSON.

## 🛠 Features

- Accurate heading detection (H1/H2/H3) for English and multilingual (CJK) PDFs
- Handles resumes, forms, research reports, and business documents
- Filters out noise, bullet points, glossary, and non-heading lines
- Merges PDF internal bookmarks (Table of Contents) with visual headings
- **Dockerized** for easy testing (as per hackathon rules)
- Highly configurable and robust across varied PDF layouts

## 📥 Input/Output Structure

- Place your PDF files in the `/input` folder.
- Output JSON files will be created in `/output` with the same name as the PDF.

## 📦 File List

- `heading_extractor.py` – Main logic for heading extraction
- `extract.py` – Main script for batch-processing PDFs
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies (`PyMuPDF`, `langdetect`, etc.)
- `Dockerfile` – Containerization
- `/input` – Input PDFs (to be provided by user/judges)
- `/output` – Output JSONs (generated by extractor)
- `README.md` – (This file)

## 🏅 Bonus Features

- **Multilingual (CJK) Handling:**  
  Automatically detects and extracts headings from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean documents using language detection and CJK-aware rules.
- **PDF Bookmarks Support:**  
  Combines built-in PDF bookmarks (Table of Contents) with extracted headings for extra reliability.
- **Configurable heading rules** (see code comments for easy tweaking).

## 🏗️ Usage Instructions
